# UpperLimbMotion

Introduction
==============

A clinical oriented application, along with an experimental protocol would enable clinicians without specific skills and technical knowledge on movement analysis, to perform a biomechanical analysis of manual wheelchair propulsion. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a clinical oriented application in which a complete biomechanical analysis is embedded, guiding the clinicians through the process of performing a wheelchair propulsion test and providing them with the necessary information to accomplish the analysis as well as to generate a comprehensive report with the outcome of the analysis. Therefore, a deep and objective study could be performed in a faster and more efficient manner.

Biomechanical analysis
=======================
The anatomy of the upper limb can be represented as a kinematic chain linked by different joints: shoulder, elbow and wrist. For analyzing the upper limb, a kinematic and kinetic analysis is performed in order to obtain the positions, forces and moments of the joints at any time during wheelchair propulsion. 

Technologies used
====================
Motion capture techniques are used quite broadly nowadays thanks to the different technologies available and for a very broad field of applications. In this section the technologies used for this biomechanical analysis are described.

* Kinescan system: photogrammetry system provided by the IBV (Instituto de Biomec√°nica de Valencia) based on passive markers that are detected thanks to an infrared light which is coupled to a digital camera. Furthermore, this system allows the synchronization with the device that acquires kinetic data on the hand-handrim contact point.

* SmartWheels: these wheels gather information about forces during the interaction between the hand and the ring of the wheel while propelling. Smartwheels are designed in a way that the size of the wheel is the regular size for a wheelchair and there is an instrumented ring that collects the force information thanks to the strain gauge and encoder integrated into the wheel.

Clinical application
=====================
The information obtained from both, the Kinescan and the Smartwheels, is processed through a custom-made software interface in which the inverse dynamic and post-processing algorithms are embedded, being transparent to the user.
